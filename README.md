# GoEdit Text Editor for Go

My attempt to make a text editor in Go for the Go programming language.

## Features
- [] Syntax highlighting for Go
- [x] Save file that is being edited
- [x] BASIC vim like keybindings
- [] Run Go code from the editor
- [x] Line numbers

## Inspiration
http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/ tutorial on how to make text editor in C

## Basic VIM bindings:
`t,T`, `f,F`, `h,j,k,l`, `$,0`, `:,/`, `n,N`, `D,C,a,i,O`, `x,r`

## How to build
`go build`
